## 📌 About the Project

This project analyses real estate transactions in **Paris (2022–2024)** using public data.  
We aimed to identify market trends, pricing patterns, and transaction volumes by district and property type.

**Main hypothesis:**  
*The Paris real estate market is stabilizing rather than growing. Transactions are declining, but prices remain resilient.*
